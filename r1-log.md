The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [February 5, Friday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
Did some easy questions on LeetCode to get started in this amazing journey :). In particular, 'Richest Customer Wealth' and 'Kids with the Greatest Number of Candies'. Questions were pretty easy, did the first one in Java and the second one in Python. Did not struggle on anything in particular.

### R1D2
Same deal as yesterday, did some easy LeetCode questions, all in Java. They were 'Find the Highest Altitude' and 'Maximum 69 Number'. The first one was relatively easy, struggled a bit on the second in terms of how to convert String to int and vice versa. A bit rusty in my Java skills, but this will only make it better.
